# Alto Saxophone
The **alto saxophone** is a member of the
[saxophone](saxophone "wikilink") family of
[woodwind](woodwind "wikilink") instruments. Saxophones were invented by
[Belgian](Belgians "wikilink") instrument designer [Adolphe
Sax](Adolphe_Sax "wikilink") in the 1840s and patented in 1846. The alto
saxophone is pitched in the key of [E♭](E♭_(musical_note) "wikilink"),
smaller than the [B♭](B♭_(musical_note) "wikilink")
[tenor](Tenor_saxophone "wikilink") but larger than the B♭
[soprano](Soprano_saxophone "wikilink"). It is the most common saxophone
and is used in [popular music](popular_music "wikilink"), [concert
bands](concert_band "wikilink"), [chamber
music](chamber_music "wikilink"), [solo
repertoire](List_of_concert_works_for_saxophone "wikilink"), [military
bands](military_band "wikilink"), [marching
bands](marching_band "wikilink"), [pep bands](pep_band "wikilink"),
[carnatic music](carnatic_music "wikilink"), and [jazz](jazz "wikilink")
(such as [big bands](big_band "wikilink"), [jazz
combos](jazz_combo "wikilink"), [swing music](swing_music "wikilink")).

The alto saxophone had a prominent role in the development of jazz.
Influential jazz musicians who made significant contributions include
[Don Redman](Don_Redman "wikilink"), [Jimmy
Dorsey](Jimmy_Dorsey "wikilink"), [Johnny
Hodges](Johnny_Hodges "wikilink"), [Benny
Carter](Benny_Carter "wikilink"), [Charlie
Parker](Charlie_Parker "wikilink"), [Sonny
Stitt](Sonny_Stitt "wikilink"), [Lee Konitz](Lee_Konitz "wikilink"),
[Jackie McLean](Jackie_McLean "wikilink"), [Phil
Woods](Phil_Woods "wikilink"), [Art Pepper](Art_Pepper "wikilink"),
[Paul Desmond](Paul_Desmond "wikilink"), and [Cannonball
Adderley](Cannonball_Adderley "wikilink").

Although the role of the alto saxophone in orchestral music has been
limited, influential performers include [Marcel
Mule](Marcel_Mule "wikilink"), [Sigurd
Raschèr](Sigurd_Raschèr "wikilink"), [Jean-Marie
Londeix](Jean-Marie_Londeix "wikilink"), [Eugene
Rousseau](Eugene_Rousseau_(saxophonist) "wikilink"), and [Frederick L.
Hemke](Frederick_L._Hemke "wikilink").

## Range

As with most saxophones, the alto's written range is B♭<sub>3</sub> to
F<sub>6</sub> (or F♯<sub>6</sub>), with the higher
[altissimo](altissimo "wikilink") register starting at F♯<sub>6</sub> (or
G<sub>6</sub>). The saxophone's altissimo register is more difficult to
control than that of other woodwinds and is usually only expected from
advanced players.

The alto saxophone is a [transposing
instrument](transposing_instrument "wikilink"), with pitches sounding a
major sixth lower than written. In terms of concert pitches, the alto
saxophone's range is from concert D♭<sub>3</sub> (the D♭ below [middle
C](middle_C "wikilink")—see [Scientific pitch
notation](Scientific_pitch_notation "wikilink")) to concert
A♭<sub>5</sub> (or A<sub>5</sub> on altos with a high F♯ key).

A few rare alto saxophones, like some [Selmer Mark
VI](Selmer_Mark_VI "wikilink") models, have been keyed to reach a low A,
a semitone lower, similar to [baritone
saxophones](Baritone_Saxophones "wikilink").
